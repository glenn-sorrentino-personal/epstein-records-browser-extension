## Overview

Public Records Indicator processes visible webpage text locally in your browser to detect exact name matches against a local dataset bundled with the extension.

## Data We Process

The extension may process the following data **locally on-device**:

- Visible website text in open pages (for local name matching)
- Local extension settings (if any)

## Data We Do Not Collect or Transmit

We do **not**:

- Collect personal data on a server
- Send webpage content to developer-controlled servers
- Sell user data
- Use analytics or ad trackers
- Use remote code execution

## Storage

The extension may use Chrome extension storage for local settings and local dataset behavior only.

## Third-Party Requests

When you click an inline badge, the extension opens a justice.gov page in a new tab for manual review. This action may send a standard web request to justice.gov.

## Purpose Limitation

The extension is intended only for local, investigator-style triage using neutral name-match indicators. Name matches are not identity verification and may produce false positives.

## Data Retention

Because data is processed locally and not sent to developer servers, we do not retain user browsing data on external systems.
